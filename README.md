<h2><b>Admin's View</b></h2>

<p>When an admin logs into the system, they are transferred to the Owners tab, which serves as a central hub for managing client information. </p> 

<p>This tab displays a table with essential details about each client, including their Name, Surname, and Age. Admins have the option to edit client information as needed, delete clients from the system if required, and view detailed profiles for each client, allowing for efficient management of client data and a deeper understanding of their interactions with the clinic.</p>
