<h2><b>Admin's View</b></h2>

<p>When an admin logs into the system, they are transferred to the Owners tab, which serves as a central hub for managing client information. </p> 

<p>This tab displays a table with essential details about each client, including their Name, Surname, and Age. Admins have the option to edit client information as needed, delete clients from the system if required, and view detailed profiles for each client, allowing for efficient management of client data and a deeper understanding of their interactions with the clinic.</p>

<p>The administrator has the ability to delete clients from the system. When the delete button is clicked, a confirmation window appears, prompting the administrator to confirm the deletion of the specific client. This ensures that accidental deletions are prevented and allows the administrator to review the action before proceeding.</p>

<p>In the Vaccines tab, administrators can view all vaccines stored in the system. Each vaccine entry includes three key actions: an Edit button to modify the vaccineâ€™s name, a Delete button to remove a specific vaccine, and a Details button. Clicking Details reveals a list of all pets that have received the selected vaccine, enabling administrators to track vaccination history at the individual pet level. This streamlined interface ensures efficient management of vaccine records and their association with pets.</p>
